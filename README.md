Iris flower classification is the process of categorizing iris flowers into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. This task uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the flowers' features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The goal is to accurately predict the species based on these measurements.
